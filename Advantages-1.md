# Overview 
An “advantage” is a useful trait that gives you a mental, physical, or social “edge” over someone else who otherwise has the same abilities as you. Each advantage has a cost in character points. This is fixed for some advantages; others can be bought in “levels,” at a cost per level (e.g., Acute Vision costs 2 points/level, so if you want Acute Vision 6, you must pay 12 points). Advantages with “Variable” cost are more complicated; read the advantage description for details. 

- You can start out with many advantages as you can afford – although some advantages are forbidden to certain kinds of characters. You can also add advantages in play, if the GM permits. For instance (Status, Wealth, etc.) are advantages, that you could realistically acquire in the course of the game. Magic and high technology can often grant advantages as well.

## Types of Advantages 
Advantages fall into several broad categories, each of which has affects who can possess those advantages and how they work in play. The categories being: Mental 🧠, Physical 💪, and Social 🤝. Special categories are: Exotic 👽, Supernatural ⚡, and Mundane 🗞️

###### Mental Advantages 🧠
Originate from your mind, or perhaps even your soul. They stay with you even if your mind ends up in a new body due to possession, a brain transplant, etc. Magical, psionic, and spiritual traits usually fall into this category. Most mental advantages work automatically, but a few require a roll against IQ, Perception, or Will to use. Mental advantages are marked 🧠. 

###### Physical Advantages 💪
Are part of your body. You lose these traits if your mind moves to a new body – and if another mind takes over your body, the body’s new owner gains your physical advantages. Advantages provided by bionics and similar implants usually fall into this category. Make a HT roll to activate any physical advantage that does not work automatically. Physical advantages are marked 💪. 

###### Social Advantages 🤝
Are associated with your identity. Whether identity is a facet of mind or of body depends on the game world. In a fantasy setting, a demon might possess a duke and “become” a respected noble instead of a feared demon, while in a far-future society, people might routinely “upload” into new bodies with no effect on social standing. As with all things, the GM’s word is final. Social advantages are marked 🤝. Many exotic and supernatural advantages (see below) could belong to more than one of these categories. This is noted (e.g., as 🧠/💪) where especially appropriate. The GM has the final say. The 🧠, 💪, 🤝 and markers are meant to assist GM judgment, not replace it.

###### Exotic Advantages 👽
Are traits that ordinary humans cannot have without ultra-tech body modification or similar tampering; for instance, extra arms or death-ray vision. Nonhumans will often have exotic advantages on a racial basis, but this doesnot entitle them to add such traits freely. You need the GM’s permission to add exotic traits that do not appear on your racial template. Exotic advantages are marked 👽.

###### Supernatural Advantages ⚡
Are impossible in nature and cannot be justified by science – or even “superscience.” They rely on divine intervention, magic, psionics, etc. The classic example is magical talent. Supernatural traits differ from exotic ones in that anyone might be supernaturally gifted – even a “normal” human, if the GM permits. Having a trait like this does not automatically mark you as an alien or a mutant. Supernatural advantages are marked ⚡.

###### Mundane Advantages 🗞️
Are inborn or learned edges and knacks that anyone might have. There are normally no restrictions on who may possess a mundane advantage. Mundane advantages are not specially marked – if you don’t see 👽 or ⚡, the advantage is mundane and available to anyone with the GM’s permission. This last point is important! Some mundane traits are intended for cinematic campaigns; the GM may forbid them in realistic games. Cinematic traits are always clearly indicated in the text.

**Ntaede's notes**: *Some advantages contain a lot of information. I've included a TLDR for such cases in order to help player orient themselves.*

# Mental Advantages 🧠
**Blessed** 🧠⚡
- Variable Cost
  
You are attuned to a god. This can take various forms, but in all cases, you will lose this advantage if you fail to act in accordance with your deity’s rules and values. Work out the details with your GM; for instance, the God of Fire might require you to stare into flames for an hour, after which you hear a voice in the flames.
- **Blessed**: You sometimes receive wisdom from your deity. After communing with your god (meditating, praying, etc.) for at least one hour, you see visions or witness omens that have some bearing on future events. The GM rolls secretly against your IQ to determine whether you gain any useful insight from this experience. The ritual is fatiguing, however; at the end of the hour, you lose 10 FP. As a side benefit, followers of your deity sense your special status and react to you at +1. **10 points**.
- **Very Blessed**: As above, but your IQ roll to interpret visions is at +5 and the reaction bonus from your god’s followers is +2. **20 points**.
- **Heroic Feats**: Your blessing gives you the ability to perform a particular heroic feat. Once per game session, you may add 1d to one of ST, DX, or HT (other traits, such as Basic Move, are at the GM’s discretion). You must specify which trait is boosted when you buy the advantage. This bonus lasts 3d seconds, after which your abilities revert to normal and you suffer any penalties amassed during the “heroic” period. (For instance, if your blessing boosts HP and you are reduced to -5 ¥ your normal HP but not -5 ¥ your “blessed” HP, you will die when the bonus HP wear off unless you receive some sort of healing.) **10 points**. 

The GM may choose to allow other blessings as well.

**Combat Reflexes** 🧠
15 Points 
You have extraordinary reactions, and are rarely surprised for more than a moment. You get +1 to all active defense rolls (see Defending, p. 374), +1 to Fast-Draw skill, and +2 to Fright Checks (see Fright Checks, p. 360). You never “freeze” in a surprise situation, and get +6 on all IQ rolls to wake up, or to recover from surprise or mental “stun.” Your side gets +1 on initiative rolls to avoid a surprise attack – +2 if you are the leader. For details, see Surprise Attacks and Initiative (p. 393). Combat Reflexes is included in Enhanced Time Sense (p. 52). If you have ETS, you cannot also take Combat Reflexes.

**Common Sense** 🧠
10 Points
Any time you start to do something the GM feels is STUPID, he will roll against your IQ. A successful roll means he must warn you: “Hadn’t you better think about that?” This advantage lets an impulsive player take the part of a thoughtful character.

**Danger Sense** 🧠
15 Points
You can’t depend on it, but sometimes you get this prickly feeling right at the back of your neck, and you know something’s wrong . . . If you have Danger Sense, the GM rolls once against your Perception, secretly, in any situation involving an ambush, impending disaster, or similar hazard. On a success, you get enough of a warning that you can take action. A roll of 3 or 4 means you get a little detail as to the nature of the danger. Danger Sense is included in Precognition (p. 77); if you have the latter trait, you cannot also have Danger Sense.

**Daredevil** 🧠
15 Points
Fortune seems to smile on you when you take risks! Any time you take an unnecessary risk (in the GM’s opinion), you get a +1 to all skill rolls. Furthermore, you may reroll any critical failure that occurs during such high-risk behavior.
- *Example: A gang of thugs opens fire on you with automatic weapons. If you crouch down behind a wall and return fire from cover, Daredevil gives no bonuses. If you vault over the wall and charge the gunmen, screaming, it provides all of its benefits!*

**Enhanced Defense** 🧠
Variable Cost 
You are unusually adept at evading attacks! This may be due to careful observation of your foe, focusing chi, or anything else that fits your background. There are three versions: 
- **Enhanced Block**: You have +1 to your Block score with either Cloak or Shield skill. You must specialize in one particular Block defense. **5 points**. 
- **Enhanced Dodge**: You have +1 to your Dodge score. **15 points**. 
- **Enhanced Parry**: You have +1 to your Parry score. You may take this advantage for bare hands (5 points), for any one Melee Weapon skill (5 points), or for all parries (10 points). **5 or 10 points**.

**Fearless** 🧠
2 Points/Level
You are difficult to frighten or intimidate! Add your level of Fearlessness to your Will whenever you make a Fright Check or must resist the Intimidation skill (p. 202) or a supernatural power that induces fear. You also subtract your Fearlessness level from all Intimidation rolls made against you.

**Gadgeteer** 🧠
25 or 50 Points
You are a natural inventor. You can modify existing equipment and given sufficient time and money invent entirely new gadgets as described under Gadgeteering (p. 475). This lets you design gadgets quickly, and makes it easy to realize higher-TL innovations. This advantage comes in two levels: 
- **Gadgeteer**: You are a “cinematic” gadgeteer, but your work still takes days or months, and requires a good deal of money and expensive equipment. 25 points. 
- **Quick Gadgeteer**: You can throw together wondrous gadgets in minutes or hours, and can get by with scrounged-together spare parts that cost a few percent of what a “realistic” inventor would have to spend. This level is definitely unsuitable for realistic campaigns! **50 points**.

**Gizmos** 🧠
5 Points/Gizmo (3 Max)
You always seem to have just the piece of gear you need. Once per game session per level of this advantage, you may pull out one small item of equipment that you could have been carrying. This “Gizmo” remains undefined until you reveal it. It does not even “enter play” until you take it out; thus, it cannot be damaged, lost, stolen, or found in a search. A Gizmo must be small enough to fit in an ordinary coat pocket, and must meet one of three criteria: 
- 1. An item you own but did not specifically state you were carrying. For instance, if you own a handgun, and get ambushed while driving to church, you could pull out your pistol– even if the police searched your vehicle five minutes ago and found no weapons! 
- 2. An item that you probably own, and that is in keeping with your character concept, but that is minor or ignorable enough to leave unspecified. For instance, a policeman might happen to be carrying a spare handcuff key, while a wizard might have some eye of newt. The GM has the final say, but should be lenient if the item you wish to have is consistent with your character story. 
- 3. An inexpensive device widely available at your tech level. For instance, if you need to light the fuse on some dynamite, you could pull out a box of matches – and they would work, even if you just took an involuntary swim in the creek.

**Gunslinger** 🧠
25 points
You can make uncannily precise shots without aiming. This ability works with any weapon that uses Beam Weapons, Gunner, Guns, or Liquid Projector skill. It gives no bonuses when using muscle-powered missile weapons (but the GM is free to introduce a low-tech version that works with Blowpipe, Bow, Crossbow, Sling, etc.). 
- When firing single shots (RoF 1-3) from a one-handed weapon, you get the Accuracy bonus of your weapon without the need for an Aim maneuver. 
- When using a two-handed weapon or automatic fire, you get half the Accuracy bonus (round up) without the need to Aim. If you do Aim, you always get full Acc, and bracing, scopes, and additional seconds of Aim provide the usual benefits.

**Indomitable** 🧠
15 Points
You are impossible to influence through ordinary words or actions. Those who wish to use Influence skills on you (see Influence Rolls, p. 359) must possess a suitable advantage: Empathy (p. 51) if you are a human or similar being, Animal Empathy (p. 40) if you’re a beast, Plant Empathy (p. 75) if you’re a plant, or Spirit Empathy (p. 88) if you’re a demon, ghost, etc. Everyone else – however convincing fails automatically. This trait often accompanies Unfazeable (p. 95).

**Talent** 🧠
Variable Cost
You have a natural aptitude for a set of closely related skills. This gives a few bonuses to such skill in levels. (Check [Talents](Talents.md) for the full explanation.)

**Versatility** 🧠
5 Points
You are extremely imaginative. You get a +1 bonus on any task that requires creativity or invention, including most rolls against Artist skill, all Engineer rolls for new inventions, and all skill rolls made to use the Gadgeteer advantage.

# Physical Advantages 💪

**Acute Senses** 💪
2 points/level
You have superior senses. Each Acute Sense is a separate advantage that gives +1 per level to all Sense rolls you make.
- **Acute Hearing** gives you a bonus to hear something, or to notice a sound (for instance, someone taking the safety off a gun in the dark). **2 points/level**.
- **Acute Taste and Smell gives** you a bonus to notice a taste or smell (for instance, poison in your drink). **2 points/level**. 
- **Acute Touch** gives you a bonus to detect something by touch (for instance, a concealed weapon when patting down a suspect). **2 points/level**.
- **Acute Vision** gives you a bonus to spot things visually, and whenever you do a visual search (for instance, looking for traps or footprints). **2 Points/level**.

**Binding** 💪👽 
2 points/level
You have an attack that can hold your target in place. Specify how this works when you buy the advantage: entangling your victim in vines, tying him up with webs, freezing him inside a block of ice, etc.
- Binding is a ranged attack with 1/2D –, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). 
- On a hit, your victim is grappled (see p. 370) and rooted in place. He cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST. 
- To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392).
- The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed. To simulate vines, webs, and so forth, add one or more of Area Effect (p. 102), Persistent (p. 107), and Wall (p. 109) – and possibly some of the special modifiers below.

**Catfall** 💪👽
10 Points 
You subtract five yards from a fall automatically (treat this as an automatic Acrobatics success – don’t check again for it). In addition, a successful DX roll halves damage from any fall. To enjoy these benefits, your limbs must be unbound and your body free to twist as you fall.

**Chameleon** 💪👽
5 points per level
You can change your surface pattern to blend into your surroundings. In any situation where being seen is a factor, you get +2 per level to Stealth skill when perfectly still, or +1 per level if moving. Clothing reduces this bonus to +1 per level when you are motionless, with no bonus if you are moving (unless the clothing is, in the GM’s opinion, camouflaged relative to your current environment). Chameleon does not normally help in the dark or against someone relying upon senses other than sight. However, you can specify that your ability is effective against a particular visual or scanning sense (e.g., Infravision or Radar) instead of normal vision.

**Claws** 💪👽
Variable Cost
You have claws. This advantage modifies all your hands and feet; there is no discount for claws on only some of your limbs. There are several variations:

- **Blunt Claws**: Very short claws, like those of a dog. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a punch or kick; e.g., 2d-3 becomes 2d-1. **3 points**. 
- **Hooves**: Hard hooves, like those of a horse. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a kick, and give your feet (only) +1 DR. **3 points**. 
- **Sharp Claws**: Short claws, like those of a cat. Change the damage you inflict with a punch or kick from crushing to cutting. **5 points**.

**Clinging** 💪👽
20 Points 
You can walk or crawl on walls and ceilings. You can stop at any point and stick to the surface without fear of falling. Neither feat requires a roll against Climbing skill, provided the surface is one you can cling to. Move while clinging is half your Movement Speed.
- If you are falling and try to grab a vertical surface to break your fall, the GM must first decide whether there is anything in reach. If there is, make a DX roll to touch the surface, and then make a ST roll at -1 per 5 yards already fallen. If you succeed, you stop your fall. Otherwise, you continue to fall – but you may subtract 5 yards.

**Constriction Attack** 💪👽
15 Points
Your musculature is optimized for crushing your opponents – whether by “hugging” like a bear or constricting like a python. To use this ability, you must first successfully grapple your intended victim, whose Size Modifier (p. 19) cannot exceed your own. On your next turn, and each successive turn, roll a Quick Contest: your ST vs. your victim’s ST or HT, whichever is higher. If you win, your victim takes damage equal to your margin of victory; otherwise, he takes no damage.

**Damage Resistance** 💪👽
5 points/level
Your body itself has a Damage Resistance score. Subtract this from the damage done by any physical or energy attack after the DR of artificial armor (you can normally wear armor over natural DR) but before multiplying the injury for damage type. By default, natural DR does not protect your eyes or help against purely mental attacks, such as telepathy. One level equals 1 DR.

**Dark Vision** 💪👽
25 Points
You can see in absolute darkness using some means other than light, radar, or sonar. You suffer no skill penalties for darkness, no matter what its origin. However, you cannot see colors in the dark.
- Special Enhancements Color Vision: You can see colors in the dark. +20%.

**Elastic Skin** 💪👽
20 Points
You can alter your skin and facial features (but not clothing or makeup) to duplicate those of another member of your race or a very similar race. This takes 10 seconds, and requires a Disguise roll if you try to duplicate a particular individual. It takes three seconds to return to your original form. This ability gives +4 to all Disguise rolls.

**Enhanced Move** 💪👽
20 points
You can really move! This Enhanced Move doubles your top speed in one environment: Air, Ground, Space, or Water. 

**Extra Attack** 💪
25 points/attack
You can attack more than once per turn. The “default” assumption in GURPS is that you can make one attack per turn, no matter how many limbs you have. Each Extra Attack allows one additional attack per turn. You may not have more attacks than you have limbs (arms, legs, etc.), natural weapons (Strikers, Teeth, etc.), and attack powers (Afflictions, Bindings, and Innate Attacks) with which to attack. The GM’s word on what constitutes an “attack” is final.
- A normal human can purchase one Extra Attack. This lets him attack with both hands at once, and represents unusually good coordination. Supers and nonhumans have no such limitation. A super-powered cop could buy two Extra Attacks, enabling him to shoot rays from his eyes, fire his pistol, and swing his nightstick all at once. A dragon might take four Extra Attacks and attack five times with any combination of his four clawed limbs, teeth, horns, tail, and fiery breath! 
- Extra Attack is exactly that: an extra Attack maneuver on your turn in combat. It does not eliminate the -4 penalty for an “off” hand (see Ambidexterity, p. 39) or let you take multiple Aim maneuvers (see Enhanced Tracking, p. 53). You may use some of your attacks for Feint maneuvers, but you many not take multiple actions of other kinds.
- **Extra Attacks and All-Out Attack**: When an individual with Extra Attacks makes an All-Out Attack, he must select one type of bonus for all his attacks that turn. He could not, for instance, take All-Out Attack (Determined) with one attack and AllOut Attack (Strong) with another. If he chooses All-Out Attack (Double) to increase his number of attacks, he gets one additional attack.
- **Extra Attacks and Rapid Strike**: You may use one of your melee attacks to make a Rapid Strike (see p. 370) on your turn, at the usual penalty. Your remaining attacks are in addition to this Rapid Strike, and receive no penalty. You may not use Rapid Strike with two or more attacks in one turn.

**Fit** 💪
5 or 15 Points
You have better cardiovascular health than your HT alone would indicate. This comes in two levels: 
- **Fit**: You get +1 to all HT rolls (to stay conscious, avoid death, resist disease or poison, etc.). This does not improve your HT attribute or HTbased skills! You also recover FP at twice the normal rate. **5 points**. 
- **Very Fit**: As above, but the bonus to HT rolls is +2. In addition, you lose FP at only half the normal rate. **15 points**. 
In both cases, this advantage applies only to FP lost to exertion, heat, etc. It has no effect on FP spent to power psi or magic spells.

**Flexibility** 💪
5 or 15 Points
Your body is unusually flexible. This advantage comes in two levels: 
- **Flexibility**: You get +3 on Climbing rolls; on Escape rolls to get free of ropes, handcuffs, and similar restraints; on Erotic Art skill; and on all attempts to break free in close combat (see p. 391). You may ignore up to-3 in penalties for working in close quarters (including many Explosives and Mechanic rolls). **5 points**. 
- **Double-Jointed**: As above, but more so. You cannot stretch or squeeze yourself abnormally, but any part of your body may bend any way. You get +5 on Climbing, Erotic Art, and Escape rolls, and on attempts to break free. You may ignore up to -5 in penalties for close quarters. **15 points**.

**Hard to Kill** 💪
2 Points/level
You are incredibly difficult to kill. Each level of Hard to Kill gives +1 to HT rolls made for survival at -HP or below, and on any HT roll where failure means instant death (due to heart failure, poison, etc.). If this bonus makes the difference between success and failure, you collapse, apparently dead (or disabled), but come to in the usual amount of time – see Recovering from Unconsciousness (p. 423). A successful Diagnosis roll (or a Mechanic roll, for machines) reveals the truth.

**Hard to Subdue** 💪
2 Points/level
You are hard to knock out. Each level of Hard to Subdue gives +1 to any HT roll to avoid unconsciousness– whether as a result of injury, drugs, or ultra-tech weapons – and to resist supernatural abilities that cause unconsciousness.

**High Manual Dexterity** 💪
5 Points/level
You have remarkably fine motor skills. Each level (to a maximum of four) gives +1 to DX for tasks that require a delicate touch. This includes all DX-based rolls against Artist, Jeweler, Knot-Tying, Leatherworking, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Sewing, Sleight of Hand, and Surgery, as well as DX-based rolls to do fine work with Machinist or Mechanic (e.g., on clockwork). This bonus doesn’t apply to IQ based tasks or large-scale DX-based tasks, nor does it apply to combatrelated die rolls of any kind.

**High Pain Threshold** 💪
10 level
You are as susceptible to injury as anyone else, but you don’t feel it as much. You never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning – and if you are tortured physically, you get +3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.

**Less Sleep** 💪
2 Points/level
You need less sleep than most people. A normal human requires 8 hours of sleep per night. Each level of this advantage – to a maximum of four levels – lets you get by with one hour less than this, giving you a few extra hours each day in which to study or work on other projects.

**Super Climb** 💪👽
3 Points/level
You can climb very quickly. Each level of Super Climbing gives you +1 Move when climbing or using the Clinging advantage (p. 43).

**Super Jump** 💪👽
10 Points/level
You can make superhuman leaps! Each level of Super Jump doubles the distance and height you can achieve when jumping (see Jumping, p. 352). Your Move while jumping is the greater of your normal ground Move and 1/5 your maximum long jump distance (thus, your maximum jump never takes more than five seconds). For instance, if your long jump were 100 yards, your jumping Move would be the greater of 20 and your normal ground Move. 
- You can jump at a foe in order to slam him. Figure the slam at your maximum jumping Move! You don’t need to make a separate roll to jump accurately. 
- Finally, if you fall a distance less than or equal to your maximum high jump, you take no damage. You can increase this distance by five yards with a successful Acrobatics roll.

**Voice** 💪
10 Points 
You have a naturally clear, resonant, and attractive voice. This gives you +2 with the following skills: Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Mimicry, Performance, Politics, Public Speaking, Sex Appeal, and Singing. You also get +2 on any reaction roll ma





# Social Advantages🤝
**Ally** 🤝
Variable Cost
Many fictional heroes have partners – loyal comrades, faithful sidekicks, trusted retainers, or lifelong friends – who accompany them on adventures. These partners are “Allies.” 
- This perk grants you a companion NPC that follows you. Note that this advantage doesn't grant you an extra PC, since the GM controls the actions of the ally. For more detailed info and cost check: [Allies](Allies.md).

**Charisma** 🤝
5 points per level
You have a natural ability to impress and lead others. Anyone can acquire a semblance of charisma through looks, manners, and intelligence – but real charisma is independent of these things. Each level gives +1 on all reaction rolls made by sapient beings with whom you actively interact (converse, lecture, etc.); +1 to Influence rolls (see Influence Rolls, p. 359); and +1 to Fortune-Telling, Leadership, Panhandling, and Public Speaking skills. 

**Contact** 🤝
Variable Cost
You have an associate who provides you with useful information, or who does small (pick any two of “quick,” “nonhazardous,” and “inexpensive”) favors for you. The point value of a Contact is based on the skill he uses to assist you, the frequency with which he provides information or favors, and his reliability as a person.
- Check [Contacts](Contacts.md) for the full explanation.

**Favor** 🤝
Variable
You saved someone’s life, kept silent at the right time, or otherwise did someone a good turn. Now he owes you one. 
- A Favor is a one-shot Ally, Contact, Contact Group, or Patron. Work out the point cost of the parent advantage, and then divide it by 5 (round up) to get the cost of the Favor. The catch is that the NPC(s) in question will help you out once . . . and only once. 
- When you wish to “collect” on your Favor, the GM rolls against the frequency of appearance of the underlying advantage. On a failure, you couldn’t reach your “friend” in time, or he couldn’t comply, but you still have your Favor coming. You may try again on a later adventure.
